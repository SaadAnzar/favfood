## Solution

#### I have made a google authentication using firebase.
#### I have fetched data from the [TheMealDB.com](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) api and displayed on home page.####
#### I have added a button to save particular meals.
#### When a user clicks on save button, the data gets stored in FireStore.
#### I am then fetching data from FireStore and user can view their favourite foods on favouritefoods endpoint.
#### I have also added functionality so that user can not save particular meal unless signed in.
#### When the user signs in, it also shows which meal they have already saved.
#### The user can also remove food items from favourites if they want.
